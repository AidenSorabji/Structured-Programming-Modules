# Structured-Programming 1-2 ‚å®Ô∏è
This repo contains modules 1-28, from "Structured Programming 1 & 2". Everything within this repo is complete (one thing needs to be added, check **updates** down below).

Feel free to fork the project to make it better! Any type of code that makes any of the modules better will be added to the repo (IF the added code has something to do with the module).

# Updates üì¨
- For right now, this repo is missing "PROJECT_M". This will be coming at a later date, as I have not entirely  completed it.
- Some of the code does not have the extras, I will make sure to update them as I make this repo (other user's helping would be greatly appreciated!)

# License and Using ¬©
Please when using this code, credit me. In addition, please do not use this code to complete your code for an assignment, as I am not held responsible for people who do, and for anyone that will do.
